</tr></tbody></table><h3 id="heart-of-the-dragon">Heart of the Dragon</h3>
<p>Starting at 1st level, you get advantage on saving throws against effect that make you frightened or paralyzed.</p>
<h3 id="dragon-breath">Dragon Breath</h3>
<p>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to exhale energy of a type chosen from that list: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison in a 15-foot cone as an action.<br>Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your warlock spell save DC, taking <em>n</em>d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, where <em>n</em> is your warlock level.<br>You can expend a spell slot when using this ability to increase the size of the cone by 15ft by level of the spell slot.<br>You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.<br>(Maybe give an instant recharge chance of 1d6)</p>
<h3 id="chromatic-soul">Chromatic Soul</h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your link to your Patron allows you to serve as a conduit for elemental energy.<br>Every dawn, you choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.<br>You have resistance to the damage type you chose, and when you cast a spell that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.</p>
<pre><code>Your patron is a dragon god or a dragon of immense power. Being connected to such power can cause changes in your behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. At times, your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron, and a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your days. But you know that your mission is among mortals for now, and that your pact binds you to bring light to the dark places of the world. Beings of this sort include Vecna, Lord of the Hand and the Eye; the dread Iuz; the lich-queen Vol; the Undying Court of Aerenal; Vlaakith, lich-queen of the githyanki; and the deathless wizard Fistandantalus.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="dragon-fear">Dragon Fear</h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can summon a true dragon’s pressure. As an action, every creatures that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is frightened by you for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). </p>
<p>While frightened by this ability, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the ability ends for that creature.</p>
<p>You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>
<h3 id="dragon-flight">Dragon Flight</h3>
<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.</p>
<p>You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.</p>
<p>Your Dragon Breath ability may function differently while in flight:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Descending Spread: while in stationary flight, you may aim your Dragon Breath at the square on the floor directly beneath you. The breath then spreads to reach a circle with a radius of 15ft centered on the square. The circle's radius expends if you expend a spell slot to strenghen your breath as per the Dragon Breath ability.</li>
  <li> Line Bombardment:  while in a moving flight, you may aim your Dragon Breath at the square on the floor directly beneath you as you fly. The breath then spreads to reach a line with a width of 5ft centered on the square. The line's width expends if you expend a spell slot to strenghen your breath as per the Dragon Breath ability divided by 2 rounded down to the closest multiple of 5.</li>
</ul>

<p>After clicking the “Print” item in the navbar a new page will open and a print dialog will pop-up.</p>

<li>Set the <strong>Destination</strong> to “Save as PDF”</li>

<li>Set <strong>Paper Size</strong> to “Letter”</li>
<li>If you are printing on A4 paper, make sure to have the “A4 page size snippet” in your brew</li>
<li>In <strong>Options</strong> make sure “Background Images” is selected.</li>
<li>Hit print and enjoy! You’re done!</li>

<p>If you want to save ink or have a monochrome printer, add the <strong>Ink Friendly</strong> snippet to your brew before you print</p>

<h3 id="not-quite-markdown">Not quite Markdown</h3>
<p>Although the Homebrewery uses Markdown, to get all the styling features from the PHB, we had to get a little creative. Some base HTML elements are not used as expected and I’ve had to include a few new keywords.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Horizontal Rules</strong> are generally used to <em>modify</em> existing elements into a different style. For example, a horizontal rule before a blockquote will give it the style of a Monster Stat Block instead of a note.</li>
<li><strong>New Pages</strong> are controlled by the author. It’s impossible for the site to detect when the end of a page is reached, so indicate you’d like to start a new page, use the new page snippet to get the syntax.</li>
<li><strong>Code Blocks</strong> are used only to indicate column breaks. Since they don’t allow for styling within them, they weren’t that useful to use.</li>
<li><strong>HTML</strong> can be used to get <em>just</em> the right look for your homebrew. I’ve included some examples in the snippet icons above the editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>blind area, poison 8d6 + 4d6 per turn, gives poisoned status that puts to sleep</p>
<h3 id="images">Images</h3>
<p>Images must be hosted online somewhere, like imgur. You use the address to that image to reference it in your brew. Images can be included ‘inline’ with the text using Markdown-style images. However for background images more control is needed.</p>
<p>Background images should be included as HTML-style img tags. Using inline CSS you can precisely position your image where you’d like it to be. I have added both a inflow image snippet and a background image snippet to give you exmaples of how to do it.</p>
<h3 id="crediting-me">Crediting Me</h3>
<p>If you’d like to credit The Homebrewery in your brew, I’d be flattered! Just reference that you made it with The Homebrewery.</p>
